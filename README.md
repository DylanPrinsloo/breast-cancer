### Predictive Maintenance using series analysis and machine learning

# The predicitve model will utilize:

# Data Collection
  - Collect sensor data from records given

# Data Preprocessing 
  - Clean data and scale it

# Feature engineering
  - using time based vents
  - Will have specific domain features

# The ML models being used
  - Arima, LSTM and Pophet
  - Random forest, Gradiant boosting and SVM

# Model Training 
  - Split data types
  - Train
  - Validation

# Model Evaluation
  - Deploy to productuon ( real time )
  - Monitorting
